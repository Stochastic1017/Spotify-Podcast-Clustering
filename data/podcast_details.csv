American Railroad,5qn1n7LvaLet6AGbWvaEc5,"Embark on ""American Railroad,"" a five-episode podcast that seeks to highlight the untold stories and unheard voices from the diverse communities that built America‚Äôs railway systems. Hosted by Grammy Award-winning musician and Silkroad Artistic Director Rhiannon Giddens, American Railroad is produced in partnership with PRX. ¬†Silkroad, founded by Yo-Yo Ma in 1998, was inspired by the historical Silk Road and created as a model for cultural collaboration through music. In 2020, Rhiannon Giddens was named Artistic Director and immediately embarked on a mission to unearth the forgotten stories of America. Silkroad‚Äôs American Railroad project‚Äîyears in the making‚Äîembodies Giddens‚Äôs vision for the Ensemble by shedding light on those erased or overlooked in American history while showcasing Silkroad's unique ability to amplify diverse voices. The project has since evolved into cross-country tours and performances, recording releases, educational materials, and this podcast series. ¬†After the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad, a trip from coast to coast that used to take months was shortened to just under a week, allowing for the transport of goods and ideas across the continent in ways previously inconceivable. Profit-seeking corporations and the American government financed it, but the people who actually built and were most affected by it are the focus ‚Äî Indigenous and African Americans as well Irish, Chinese, Japanese, and other immigrant laborers whose contributions have been largely erased from history.

The journey also takes us to the Standing Rock Reservation, showcasing the resilience and musical traditions of the Lakota community.

The Deck Investigates,2bHbTXBLRwdJVL6blVI6wo,"""The Deck Investigates"" returns with Season 2, delving deep into the perplexing case of Ada Haradine, a 40-year-old mother of two who vanished without a trace from her Elkhart, Indiana home on a seemingly ordinary Wednesday afternoon in May 1985.  Over 14 gripping episodes, we meticulously reconstruct the events leading up to Ada's disappearance, exploring the initial efforts to find her and the myriad of suspects and theories that emerged in the wake of her vanishing.  The investigation takes a dramatic turn when Ada's remains are discovered three years later in a wooded area 12 miles from her home, transforming a missing persons case into a homicide investigation. As law enforcement scrambles to make sense of new evidence, the focus shifts to surprising potential suspects, including Ada's neighbor.  Through exclusive interviews with family members, law enforcement, and key witnesses, ""The Deck Investigates"" grapples with questions about the challenges of pursuing justice decades after a crime.  Join us as we peel back the layers of this baffling cold case, reexamine old leads, and shine a light on overlooked details in the quest to finally answer the question: Who killed Ada Haradine, and why?",audiochuck,34,True,https://open.spotify.com/show/2bHbTXBLRwdJVL6blVI6wo,https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8ad4172a9bc5b8aab367ac8aeb,True Crime,"rgb(225, 36, 44)"
