Featuring in-depth musical and cultural analysis from legendary artists, critics, and thought leaders, including Barack and Michelle Obama, Questlove, Smokey Robinson, Janelle Monae, George Clinton, and many more, Audible's new, authorized Original invites audiences on an intimate and sweeping journey deeply infused with star-studded contributors‚Äô unique experiences and impassioned fandom. Hosted by New York Times Pulitzer Prize-winning culture critic Wesley Morris, The Wonder of Stevie revisits Wonder's iconic creative evolution, his transformative spiritual path, and the profound inspiration he drew from both the beauty and pain of the Black American experience‚Äîdriving his eventual emergence as his generation‚Äôs most unflinching and uplifting artistic voice. With each episode dedicated to a particular album, listeners can follow Stevie Wonder‚Äôs classic period chronologically or jump to a favorite record or time period of interest.Set to over 40 of Wonder‚Äôs legendary tunes, the series culminates in a final moving episode exclusive to Audible that finds Stevie Wonder in a profound and enlightening conversation with former president Barack Obama. The Wonder of Stevie is the definitive celebration and examination of a towering icon at the absolute height of his creative powers. Sit back and ""luxuriate"" in his genius, as Morris puts it.

I‚Äôm the guy that you probably don‚Äôt know by name, but when you see my face you might say ‚Äúoh, that guy from that thing.‚Äù I‚Äôve befriended some of the most talented people in the business, but it wasn‚Äôt until I started inviting them into my home that I realized, I didn‚Äôt really know these people. What started as me having some fun, quickly evolved into something I‚Äôve fallen in love with. What I‚Äôve discovered is that all these people aren‚Äôt that different from you and me. They have the same insecurities and flaws that we all deal with every day. In a dark, yet enlightening way... I find a lot of comfort in that. I invite you all to join me while I get inside each of these fascinating people.",Cumulus Podcast Network,en,350,True,https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8a94d49f9ea514d60886c38d0c,https://open.spotify.com/show/6Q5Cn2tO2yeCdJt4Bq88zS,TV & Film,"rgb(230, 164, 148)",-2.8078434542564277,0.36802703511006696,-0.2710866124404186,-13.900379,5.7044497,-3.2858481,-1.3838528,6.4984827,0.044951454
