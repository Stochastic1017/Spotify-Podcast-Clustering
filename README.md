# Clustering Spotify Podcasts with NLP-Driven Insights

## Introduction

Spotify has already developed several music-specific metrics/derived features about a particular track/music, specifically: (a) acousticness, (b) danceability, (c) energy, (d) instrumentalness, (e) speechiness, and (f) valence.
All these metrics are in the range of [0,1] and can be used to cluster users based on their musical taste. This project is meant to construct similar informative metrics for Spotifyâ€™s podcast data, and create a novel recommendation system based on these metrics.
